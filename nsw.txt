The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), which are used by computers to locate and communicate with each other on a network.

How It Works:
Query Initiation: When you enter a domain name in a browser, the system sends a DNS query to resolve the name.
Recursive Resolver: Your device contacts a recursive DNS resolver (often provided by your ISP or a public DNS like Google DNS).
Root Servers: The resolver queries a root DNS server to find the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) server (e.g., .com).
TLD Servers: The TLD server directs the resolver to the authoritative server for the specific domain.
Authoritative Server: This server provides the IP address for the domain.
Response: The resolver returns the IP address to your device, which then uses it to connect to the server hosting the website or service.
This process happens in milliseconds and allows seamless access to web services using user-friendly names instead of numeric IP addresses.

Troubleshooting an Inaccessible Website
Check Server Availability: Use ping or tracert to confirm the server is reachable.
Verify DNS Resolution: Ensure the domain resolves to the correct IP address using nslookup.
Inspect IIS Configuration: Check site bindings, SSL certificates, and application pool status.
Examine Logs: Review IIS logs and application logs for errors (e.g., HTTP 500, authentication failures).
Test Locally: Access the site from the server itself to rule out external network issues.

Troubleshooting an Intermittently Failing Scheduled Task
Review Task History: Enable history for the task and check for error messages or failure codes.
Check Dependencies: Ensure all required files, databases, or network resources are available at runtime.
Inspect Script/Executable: Test the script or executable manually and check for runtime errors.
Monitor System Resources: Identify resource contention (e.g., high CPU, memory usage) during execution.
Enable Logging: Add verbose logging to the task/script to capture additional details for debugging.

General Knowledge
1. DNS and Domain Name Resolution
Purpose: DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses for communication between devices.
Troubleshooting DNS Issues:
Use nslookup or dig to check if the domain resolves to the correct IP.
Verify DNS settings on the local system (e.g., DNS server addresses).
Check for propagation delays or misconfigured DNS records (A, CNAME, etc.).
2. Troubleshooting Network Connectivity
Diagnosing Connectivity Issues:
Use ping to test basic reachability between systems.
Use tracert (Windows) or traceroute (Linux) to identify network path issues or bottlenecks.
Resolving Latency/Packet Loss:
Check for overloaded network devices or bad links (e.g., using a network monitoring tool).
Identify and resolve bandwidth issues or misconfigurations (e.g., QoS or MTU size).

Problem Solving - Authentication Issues
Verify Whether the Issue is on the User’s Side or Server-Side:

Confirm the user’s credentials are correct and not expired.
Test authentication using another known working account or device.
Check for client-side issues like incorrect domain settings or cached credentials.
Debug Potential Active Directory or Application Configuration Problems:

Verify the application’s connection to Active Directory (e.g., using tools like ldp.exe or ADExplorer).
Check for misconfigured authentication methods (e.g., Kerberos vs. NTLM) or expired service accounts.
Review group membership and permissions for the user in Active Directory.
Handle Situations Where the Issue Affects Multiple Users or Systems:

Investigate if the issue is related to domain controller replication or network connectivity.
Check server logs for common errors (e.g., Event Viewer’s Security or Application logs).
Ensure that any recent changes to authentication configurations or policies are reverted or corrected.
