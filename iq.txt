General Knowledge - Networking Basics
DNS and Domain Name Resolution
Explain the purpose of DNS and how domain names are resolved into IP addresses.
Describe the role of DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) and how they are configured.
How would you troubleshoot DNS-related issues, such as a domain name not resolving properly?
Troubleshooting Network Connectivity
Use tools like ping, tracert, or pathping to diagnose connectivity issues.
Describe how to troubleshoot a situation where a server cannot connect to another server, even though the network is operational.
Resolve latency or packet loss issues in a network environment.
System Administration
IIS Configuration and Troubleshooting
Configure a new website in IIS, including bindings for HTTP, HTTPS, and custom ports.
Add an SSL certificate to a website in IIS.
Manage multiple IIS sites on the same server while avoiding port conflicts.
Identify root causes of HTTP errors like 404, 403, or 500 in IIS.
Use tools or logs for diagnosing IIS issues (e.g., Failed Request Tracing, Event Viewer).
Handle application pool crashes or high memory usage in IIS.
Scheduled Tasks and Automation Using PowerShell
Monitor Windows Scheduled Tasks to ensure they execute reliably.
Identify the cause of failed tasks, such as enabling task history or checking for dependencies.
Debug recurring failures in critical scheduled tasks.
Write PowerShell scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as file backups or service restarts.
Provide an example of a complex script used to simplify a multi-step process.
Manage credentials securely in PowerShell scripts when accessing resources like databases or remote servers.
Security & Monitoring
Active Directory Integration
Integrate an application with Active Directory for user authentication.
Explain the difference between Kerberos and NTLM authentication, and when to use each.
Manage and audit permissions for service accounts in Active Directory.
Problem Solving
Scenario-Based Troubleshooting
Website Not Accessible: A website hosted in IIS is not accessible, but the server is reachable.
Identify the issue through DNS, IIS configuration, or application logs.
Use tools and logs (e.g., IIS logs, application logs) to diagnose the issue.
Scheduled Task Intermittently Failing: A scheduled task intermittently fails to execute.
Determine whether the issue is related to resource contention, permissions, or task configuration.
Use tools or techniques to diagnose and resolve the issue, such as enabling verbose logging.
Prevent similar failures in the future.
Authentication Issues: A user reports being unable to access an application due to authentication problems.
Verify whether the issue is on the userâ€™s side or server-side.
Debug potential Active Directory or application configuration problems.
Handle situations where the issue affects multiple users or systems.
Soft Skills
Handling Cross-Discipline Tasks
Describe a time when you stepped outside your primary expertise to assist a team member or resolve a critical issue.
Explain how you approach working on tasks that span multiple domains (e.g., development, system administration, database management).
Ensure effective communication and documentation when collaborating with teams that have different technical specialties.
